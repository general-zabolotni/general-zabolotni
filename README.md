- 👋 Hi, my name is Alexey. I graduated from the University of British Columbia, majoring in commerce
- 👀 Together with some fellow computer science graduates, who interned at FAANG, we are starting a project called "Learnario".
- 🌱 Our project's ultimate goal is to democratize higher education and enable thousands of people get access to high-paying jobs. 
- 💞️ In the short term, we are starting with the product management industry. We are building a website which will help anyone break into the PM industry completely for free. 
- 📫 Currently, we are in a dire need of website developers. You can reach me at alexkrec@student.ubc.ca or LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexey-krechko/)
